# PrepPal
Project goal
In developing countries where education is highly valued to uplift one's economic status and opportunities. Private institutions have centralized learning depriving those economically weak of assistance they require to excel.
Not everyone can have access to good tuition centers, coaching or teachers.
With the advent of generative AI - I decided to build a solution for the student community


PrepPal - a LLM powered solution that uses ChromaDB, WikiPedia and langchain to generate question papers, topic explainers, planners and also assignments for any subject and topic from classes 10-12.
Currently under development - it would also host the functionality of PDF- content assessment and memory to personalize the experience of each child and further optimize their preparation.
